                        Uzbekistan’ for conducting Governance Survey. Mahorat &
                        Management is supporting the SVRP to conduct during
                        April-July, 2022 a survey into the quality of VET
                        governance in Uzbekistan. The survey aims to evaluate
                        VET governance according to key functions of the VET
                        system. The results from this study can be used to
                        recommend changes to specific dimensions of governance.
                        The survey will be digitally managed by SVRP partner
                        CEMETS in Switzerland, but it needs preparation and
                        follow-up on the ground in Uzbekistan. It is expected
                        that the total number of survey participants exceeds
                        2,500 from the system of ministries of higher and
                        secondary specialized education, employment and labor
                        relations, the chamber of commerce and industry and
